Hello <%= @user.display_name %>,

This is a test email to confirm your bill reminder settings are working correctly.

Your current reminder settings:
* Reminder days: <%= @reminder_preference.remind_days.join(", ") %> days before due date
* Overdue notifications: <%= @reminder_preference.send_overdue_reminders? ? "Enabled" : "Disabled" %>
* Email frequency: <%= @reminder_preference.digest_frequency.titleize %>

If you received this email, your bill reminder notifications are properly configured.

Best regards,
Maybe Team
